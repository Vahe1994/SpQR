# SpQR model compression


**Note:** This repository contains quantization algorithm and the model evaluation code for SpQR method for LLM compression; 
The efficient inference code will be added soon.
    
It accompanies the research paper "[SpQR: A Sparse-Quantized Representation for Near-Lossless LLM Weight Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03078)" .

# Installation

### Packages

To run SpQR with `falcon` make sure that you have `torch>=2.0.0` with `CUDA` support.

Install packages from `requirements.txt`:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

__Note:__ the results reported in the ArXiv paper where obtained using `4.28.dev0` version of `transformers`, commit id [`464d420775`](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/archive/464d420775653885760e30d24d3703e14f4e8a14.zip).


### Loading / caching datasets and tokenizer

The script will require downloading and caching locally the relevant tokenizer and the datasets. They will be saved in `$TRANSFORMERS_CACHE` directory.

### Models

This repository is expected to work with models of `LLaMA` and `Falcon` families so far.

#### Data

For quantization with SpQR its is recommended to use the subset of the data model 
was trained on. I.e. for quantization of `LLaMA` models we recommend to use the subset
of [RedPajamas](https://huggingface.co/datasets/togethercomputer/RedPajama-Data-1T-Sample) and for `Falcon` quantization - [RefinedWeb](https://huggingface.co/datasets/tiiuae/falcon-refinedweb). Both subsets 
are stored in `data` directory: 
* `data/red_pajama_n=1024.pth`
* `data/refined_web_n=128.pth`
  
**Note** These subsets are already processed with the corresponding model tokenizer. Use for different model will lead to
unexpected behavior.

### W&B logging

For the sake of convenience one can optionally log the data to `Weights and Biases` service (wandb).
Run `pip install wandb` for W&B logging.
Specify `$WANDB_ENTITY`, `$WANDB_PROJECT`, `$WANDB_NAME` environment variables prior to running experiments. use `--wandb` argument to enable logging

# Launching

### GPU and RAM requirements
This code was developed and tested using a single A100 GPU with 80GB GPU RAM. It may successfully run on GPUs with 32GB+ VRAM for perplexity evaluation of up to `LLaMA-65B` and `Falcon-40B` models. 
With `--offload activations` option, the model perplexity may be evaluated on machines with less VRAM: 24GB+ for Llama 65B and 6GB+ for Llama 7B.
The perplexity testing code also requires RAM amount sufficient to hold uncompressed model weights (e.g. ~130GB for Llama65B) and testing datasets.
For `Language Model Evaluation Harness` evaluation one needs to have enough memory to load whole model
on one or several devices + activation tensors.

### Model downloading
The code requires the LLaMA model to be downloaded in Huggingface format and saved locally. The scripts below assume that `$TRANSFORMERS_CACHE` variable points to the Huggingface Transformers cache folder.

### Perplexity benchmarks:
This script compresses the model and then tests its performance in terms of perplexity using WikiText2, C4, and Penn Treebank datasets. 

The command to launch the script should look like this: 

```
export MODEL_PATH=<PATH_TO_MODEL_DIR>
export CUSTOM_DATA_PATH=<INSERT PATH TO CUSTOM DATA>

python main.py $MODEL_PATH custom \
    --custom_data_path=$CUSTOM_DATA_PATH \
    --wbits 4 \
    --groupsize 16 \
    --perchannel \
    --qq_scale_bits 3 \
    --qq_zero_bits 3 \
    --qq_groupsize 16 \
    --outlier_threshold=0.2 \
    --permutation_order act_order \
    --percdamp 1e0 \
    --nsamples 128 
```
The command above runs near-lossless compression as described in the article. Adjusting the above parameters allows for tighter compression with a slightly greater loss. 

Note the launch arguments:
- `<PATH_TO_MODEL_DIR>` - path to model folder, which contains `config.json `
- `one of [c4, ptb, wikitext2, custom]` -- name of dataset to use for compression
- `--custom_data_path` - path to preprocessed and tokenized dataset (if `custom` chosen). Otherwise do not specify.
- `--wbits 3` -- number of bits for quantized weights representation
- `--groupsize 16` -- size of first-order groups for compression
- `--qq_groupsize 16` -- size of second-order (quantized) groups for compression
- `--qq_scale_bits 3 --qq_zero_bits 3` -- bit sizes for quantizing first order weights' scale and zeros.
- `--offload activations` -- moves activations to RAM when not used. Reduces VRAM usage while slowing work by ~10%. 
run `python main.py --help` for more details on command line arguments, including compression parameters.

### LM Evaluation Harness benchmark.

To perform zero-shot evaluation, we use [Language Model Evaluation Harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness) framework with slight modifications. This repository contains a copy of LM Evaluation Harness repo from early 2023 in `lm-eval-harness` folder. 
#### Installation
Before running the code make sure that you have all the requirements and dependencies of `lm-eval-harness` installed. To install them run:
```
pip install -r lm-evaluation-harness/requirements.txt
```
#### Execution

The main script launching the evaluation procedure is `lmeval.py` .

Note. Current version of the script support only LLaMA/Falcon quantization. Therefore, set:
* `--model=hf-causal`
* `--model_args pretrained=$MODEL_PATH` where `$MODEL_PATH` has to be one of the LLaMA models
  
`--quantization_args` - list of comma separated arguments for quantizer. For details and options
refer to `spqr_config.py`.

Below is presented an example of benchmark launch.

```
export MODEL_PATH=<INSERT PATH_TO_MODEL_DIR>
export CUSTOM_DATA_PATH=<INSERT PATH TO CUSTOM DATA>

python lmeval.py \
    --model hf-causal \
    --model_args pretrained=$MODEL_PATH,dtype=float16,use_accelerate=True \
    --quantization_args dataset=custom,custom_data_path=$CUSTOM_DATA_PATH,wbits=4,groupsize=16,perchannel=True,qq_scale_bits=3,qq_zero_bits=3,qq_groupsize=16,percdamp=1.0,outlier_threshold=0.2,simplified_outliers=False,nsamples=128,offload_activations=True \
    --tasks winogrande,piqa,hellaswag,arc_easy,arc_challenge \
    --batch_size 1
```

Performance and runtime notes:
* For large models (LLaMA-30B, LLaMA-65B) specify `max_memory_per_gpu={value}GIB` so that there are free 15-20GIB of GPU memory for each GPU to store activations for calibration. 
* `offload_activations=True` slightly reduces peak memory consumption 
* Typically `LlaMA-30B` requires 1-2 A100 GPUs with 80Gb of memory and `LlaMA-65B` requires 3 A100 with 80Gb each.
* With enough spare GPU memory, one can raise batch size to accelerate evaluation process.
